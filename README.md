# BTS3
An updated BTS App with current versions and upgradeability via bower and npm.
I've upgraded the following libraries:
- angular
- angular-google-maps is no longer supported. I upgraded to ngmap.
- angular material
- angular material icons
- desktop web notification
- JSON3
- SVG Morpheus


## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
